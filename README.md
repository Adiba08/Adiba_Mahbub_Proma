My research interests lie in the field of AI and HCI. I'm especially interested in topics such as Machine learning and Deep Learning, and how they can be applied to problems related to NLP and multimodal data. I'm also interested in interdisciplinary research, especially related to using AI to achieve social goals. You can also check out my [github link](https://github.com/Adiba08). 

With four years of writing experience in Lifestyle, The Daily Star, which is one of the leading English newspapers in Bangladesh, I'm also very passionate about writing, especially feature writing and fiction-writing. You can learn more about my writing experiences here, or check out my [blog](https://medium.com/@adiba.proma). 

Whether you need someone for a short-term project or a long-term collaboration or simply to discuss the exciting work you're doing, I’d love to hear from you. You can contact me through email at <adiba.proma@gmail.com>. 

## Educational History 
### Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/), *(Jan 2016-Dec 2019)*

**CGPA: 3.97/4**
- Highest Distinction (Awarded to students graduating with CGPA greater than 3.8) 
- VC’s list for 8 semesters (Awarded to students with GPA greater than 3.9)

## Research 
### Analyzing Ensemble Learning Algorithms using Cluster Analysis of Binary Classification Problems
We analyzed the accuracy and time complexity of ensemble learners and generated a rule-based algorithm to rank these learners in a low-resource setting given user-defined constraints. Our research involved conducting multivariate statistical analysis and applying information theory to define binary classification datasets, and then clustering via Self-Organizing Maps to generate our rule-based algorithm. Paper details are given [here](https://github.com/Adiba08/Adiba_Mahbub_Proma/raw/main/Analyzing%20Ensemble%20Learning%20Algorithms%20using%20Cluster%20Analysis%20of%20Binary%20Classification%20Problems.pdf).
Programming language: Python

## Selected Course Projects 
### Firebot: A remote-controlled assisting robot for rescue missions 
We proposed the usage of an innovative and yet simple robot to tackle fire incidents that has become a recurrent disaster in rapidly urbanizing cities such as Dhaka. The robot, which is to be controlled via a Bluetooth module, will be equipped with three sensors- the flame sensor, smoke sensor and temperature and humidity sensor- to detect the danger level of the fire and provide the necessary data required for firefighters to be properly equipped before they enter a burning building and thus avoid further injury. The robot does this by sending data that it gets from the sensors to a remote desktop monitor via Wi-Fi. As a result, the robot will help bridge the information gap between the time residents go out and the time the firefighters reach the scene. You can find more information about our project in this [pdf report](https://github.com/Adiba08/Adiba_Mahbub_Proma/raw/main/Firebot.pdf).

**Programming Language:** Arduino 

### Bengali Character-Recognition using Neural Networks 
We used LSTM, GRU, CNN and MLP on image data of Bengali words to extract Bengali letters from those words. 

**Programming Language:** Python, **Framework:** Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, **Libraries:** Keras
